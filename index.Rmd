I am a historian of economics. My research focuses on the structuring of economics as a scientific discipline and its relationships with other social sciences, notably geography and planning sciences, after 1945. I am more particularly interested in studying the evolution of fields such as regional science, urban economics and new economic geography. 

Through these topics, I am led to explore the works of various disciplines that have influenced the research of economists interested in spatial issues. In my work I also rely a lot on quantitative tools dedicated to the study of sciences (bibliometrics techniques and network analysis).
